# html-boilerplate
## plain project starter
 
 collection of tags to start a fresh html5 project from scratch
 
 I'm using some php instruction to import other html files. You can simply replace those statements with the html code to keep it plain.
 
 The html will show up with boxes as a 'prototype mode' to learn flex-box. Simply access the css/styles.css and comment or delete the following:
 
 ```css
 border: 1px dotted var(--prototype); 
 ```
